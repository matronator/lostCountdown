#### Notice: If you like this project, please consider donating. The battery on my macbook died and I need to get it replaced to be able to work, but a battery replacement for macbook is kinda expensive and money's little tight right now. Any help would be much appretiated! Thank you :)

### A note on browser support (Safari and Chrome)...

Both Safari and it looks like now Google Chrome as well, have a problem with playing sounds without user interaction and since the alarm is controled via timer, both browsers throw an error in the console/log and refuse to play the sound.

In Safari, this can be fixed by [changing the "Settings for This Website"](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/customize-settings-per-website-ibrw7f78f7fe/mac) to allow Auto-Play. I don't know about Chrome, but I would imagine there would be some similar setting for media Auto-Play.

No issues in Firefox, other browsers not tested.
